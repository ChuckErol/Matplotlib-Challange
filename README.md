# Matplotlib-Challange

Data Cleaning:
  - Removed duplicate entries based on Mouse ID and Timepoint.
  - Filtered data for specific drug regimens (e.g., Capomulin, Ramicane).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  - Calculated summary statistics (mean, median, variance, standard deviation) for tumor volume.
  - Generated visualizations such as bar plots and scatter plots to explore relationships and trends.

Statistical Analysis:
  - Calculated correlation coefficient and performed linear regression to analyze the relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume.
  - Identified potential outliers and conducted further analysis.

Visualization:
  - Created various plots including bar plots, scatter plots, line plots, and box plots to visualize data and results.
